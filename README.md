Splash Screen inspired by #DearJuniorDev's build challenge for Week: 02-23-2023

## Our Own Pace - 1 Week

We were thinking of just doing this as a personal project in the theme of splash screens to go with what a bunch of other people are making on the DearJuniorDev Discord server."Wow, would love to participate, but the timing is not super great for this weekend, so how about we give ourselves more time and focus on having fun and learning"
